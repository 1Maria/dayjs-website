Day.js has great support for internationalization.

But none of them will be included in your build unless you use that.

You can load multiple locales and switch between them easily.

[List of supported locales](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/tree/dev/src/locale)

You are **super welcome** to add a locale by opening a pull request.
