Day.js is designed to be immutable, however, in order to make full compatible with moment.js in some legacy project, we introduce a plugin ğŸš¨ BadMutable ğŸš¨ to make Day.js mutable.

> This's __NOT__ good and __NOT__ recommended in most projects.

With this plugin enabled, all setters will update the instance itself.

```javascript
var badMutable = require('dayjs/plugin/badMutable')
dayjs.extend(badMutable)
// with ğŸš¨ BadMutable ğŸš¨ plugin
const today = dayjs()
today.add(1, 'day')
console.log(today) // update itself, value will be tomorrow
```
