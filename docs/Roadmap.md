Development roadmap for the dayjs community.

## Why started this

The original idea of the roadmap can be founded in [https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/issues/627](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/issues/627).

We want to make dayjs to cover more languages. Like `day.rs` (In Rust), `day.clj` (In Clojure) and so on.

At the same time, we also want to migrate the existing documentation to a new [website](https://dayjs.github.io/website).

There will be a lot of work to be done so we started this roadmap.

The rest of the content of this roadmap is divided into 3 parts:

- [Languages Coverage](#languages-coverage)
- [Document Migration Progress](#document-migration-progress)
- [How To Contribute](#how-to-contribute)

If you want to know what languages dayjs can also be used in, click [Languages Coverage](#languages-coverage).

If you want to know the progress of newest documentation, go to [Document Migration Progress](#document-migration-progress).

If you want to contribute to [dayjs community](https://github.com/dayjs), like add new language support, fixes documentation problems, go to [How To Contribute](#how-to-contribute).
